The challenge is to build a lightweight application to display the criteria in the test. We realise everyone has different levels of skill and experience when it comes to development, so we have listed two separate scenarios in this task for you to choose from. You can combine both if you wish or focus solely on one of the two scenarios provided.

The Brief

You should use development best practices where appropriate, supporting principles we value including; security, performance, readability, testability, scalability, simplicity. You should also aim to achieve a clean separation of concerns between components in your solution.

The scenarios are based on the business All The Beans who wants to market their products daily with a “bean of the day” mechanic.

Scenario 1

1. Create a responsive layout using modern UI frameworks or libraries.

2. Using the attached JSON file implement components to display:

· List of available coffee beans.

· Detailed view of a selected coffee bean.

· "Bean of the Day" feature which is interactable for more information.

3. Create an order form for customers to purchase coffee beans.

4. Implement a search feature to filter coffee beans by the available data.

Scenario 2

1. Design and implement a relational database schema to store the bean details from the JSON file provided.

2. Create RESTful APIs to handle CRUD operations for coffee beans and Fetch the "Bean of the Day".

3. Implement business logic to ensure:

· Each day, a new "Bean of the Day" is selected randomly from the available beans.

· The selected bean cannot be the same as the previous day.

4. Implement a database search feature to show products available


The Deliverable

· A bundled/archived repository showing your commit history or a link to an accessible private repository with your work in. We recommend Github.

· A covering note explaining the technology choices you have made.

· Any instructions required to run your solution and tests.
